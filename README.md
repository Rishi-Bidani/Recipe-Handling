# Recipe-Handling

This program will allow you to organise your recipes locally on your system
Currently, all releases are of my old version, once development of my new version is functional enough for production it will also be added to me releases

<br />

### Planned Features
  - Nicer layout and easier navigation
  - Data stored in a sqlite db
  - Search for recipes using custom tags(you can asssign the same tag to different recipes)

<br />

### New Version (Currently under development)
This is a newer more polished version for my old recipe app
Use this version because

  - It will store data inside a sqlite database rather than binary files under folders in the root directory
  - The  database file is saved under APPDATA/Local/RecipeManager, away from accidental deletion, this however 
    is only for windows users, for any other os the db will be saved under root directory
  - Since it stores data in a database, more complicated search features will be possible
  - This new version will also have a newer more polished layout
    - It makes the navigation cleaner and less complicated
    - It looks much better

<br />

### Old Project (Completed, but not recommended)
This version of the project is complete, however I don't recommend using it
Please wait for the newer version
Don't use this because
  - it stores the data as binary files
  - It stores it under folders in the root directory
  - Complicated navigation
